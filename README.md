Intellij has pnemonic bookmarks where you can assign a key to a bookmark, and then search that bookmarks using a key. 
I wanted bookmarks where I can assign a string text to it. And then search this bookmarks using that string. Therefore I made this plugin for this functionality

### How it works ? 
It assigns a string to a bookmark which you can use later to search. The bookmarks are stored using this key. If you bookmark again using the same key, it will override the previous bookmarks

### How to use it ?
