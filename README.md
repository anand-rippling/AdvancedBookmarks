# Advanced Bookmarks

Advanced Bookmarks is a modern IntelliJ IDEA plugin that lets you assign descriptive string keys to bookmarks, making code navigation and recall easier than ever. Unlike traditional bookmarks that use single keys, you can search, add, and manage bookmarks using meaningful text.

## Features
- Assign string-based keys to bookmarks
- Quickly search bookmarks by text
- Code preview with syntax highlighting
- Easy add, search, and remove actions
- Modern, intuitive UI

## How It Works
- **Add Bookmark:** Assign a string to a bookmark for easy recall. If you use the same key again, it will override the previous bookmark.
- **Search Bookmarks:** Instantly find bookmarks by typing their string key.
- **Remove Bookmarks:** Remove bookmarks by searching or from the context menu.
